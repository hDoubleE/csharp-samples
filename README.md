# Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C#

• This repo contains implementations of data structures and algorithms written in C#.

• I'm still finalizing many of the solutions here and will keep adding to this in the future.

## C-Sharp is my other favorite language

I don't have any war stories to share about it, but I've come to appreciate it a lot. It offers a lot of advantages to developers over interpreted languages. And after learning C#, Java and C++ are more familiar to me now. I have a long way to go, but wanted to share some code.
