# Data Structures and Algorithms in C#

• This repo contains implementations of data structures and algorithms written in C#.

• I intentionally use huge clunky variable names throughout this repo. While algorithm textbooks lean toward i, j, k, m, n, partition q etc...descriptive variable names help me to keep track of all the moving parts.

• I'm still finalizing this repo and will continue to refactor and add to it. Right now, I just want to get something up to give an idea of progress made over the last several months since separating from the military.

## C-Sharp is my other favorite language

I don't have any war stories to share about C#, but I've come to appreciate it. It offers a lot of advantages to developers and after learning it, Java and C++ all become more familiar. I'll try to include some examples of object oriented programming concepts in here as well at some point.
